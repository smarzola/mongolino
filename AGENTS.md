# Project Instructions

- Keep the server implementation in Rust and the durable storage layer in SQLite.
- Treat MongoDB wire compatibility as observable behavior: validate changes with real client handshakes when possible.
- Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo test` before handing off code changes.
- Keep unsupported MongoDB commands explicit by returning command errors instead of silently accepting behavior.
